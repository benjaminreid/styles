# styles
A simple set of commonly used helpers, mixins and other reusable components for any project that uses Sass.

## Prerequisites

Sass (and it's dependencies) is the only thing you need installed to compile CSS.

- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

These can be optionally installed to build the documentation and run various other tasks:

- [Node](http://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/)

## Documentation

The documentation can be built locally by running:

```
npm run docs
```

And opened in your default browser by running:

```
npm run open-docs
```

You can test out the Sass compilation by running:

```
npm run watch
```
